**Included folders**\
*AXITDC*\
TDC channel IP. Includes VHDL source files, test benches and customized Xilinx IP cores.

*board*\
Red Pitaya board definition files.

*src*\
Source files for creating a two-channel TDC system example project.

*code*\
Associated software for the TDC, including:\
TDCServer2.c - a Linux-based C program for the Zynq ARM core, which communicates with the TDC channels via the "mmap" system call. Addresses are set in the Address Editor of the TDCsystem project.\
PLclock script - contains bash commands for lowering the PL clock frequency from 125 to 100 MHz. Has to be executed before TDC implementation.\
TDCgui3.mlapp - MATLAB App Designer graphical user interface application.

*figs*\
Various figures and schematics of the TDC design.

**2-channel TDC system example project**
1. Open Vivado
2. Using the Tcl Console, navigate to the "zynq_tdc/" folder and execute "source make_project.tcl"
3. Complete the synthesis & implementation steps

**Setup on the Red Pitaya**
1. Copy the generated bitstream, PLclock script and C server on the Red Pitaya system
2. Run PLclock ("./PLclock") to lower the Zynq PL frequency to 100 MHz
3. Load the FPGA configuration ("cat TDCsystem_wrapper.bit > /dev/xdevcfg")
4. Compile and run the C server ("gcc TDCserver2.c -o TDCserver.exe" and "./TDCserver")
5. On a client PC, start the MATLAB GUI to connect to the TDC system
